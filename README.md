## RESCUEME: An Innovative Real-Time Wearable Emergency Mobile Application Utilizing LoRa Technology
### Technology Used:
- C++
- React Native
- Expo
- TypeScript
- Mapbox
- LoRa – RYLR896
- ESP8266 NODE MCU
- NEO-M8N GPS
### Description:
- Develop a prototype device that can be used in emergency and search and rescue operations.
- Consists of GPS tracking device(receiver), transmitter device and mobile app map that can be used in search and rescue operation.
- A transmitter device that uses uBlox GPS technology that send coordinates via radio frequency using LoRa - RYLR896 and ESP8266 NODE MCU as controller.
- Transmitter didn’t need any internet connections to send coordinates but need a line of sight (LOS) for clear communication between two devices and clear sky to receive a coordinate from satellite.
- Maximum of 16 km radius range with line of sight (LOS).
- Uses a mobile app map that monitor the current position of the transmitter real time.
